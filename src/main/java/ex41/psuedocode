General idea for the code, scan input list, put all of them in array list, and then have the code run through the list and sort one by one.

File reader(input.txt);
scanner(file) = String inputs;
sorting(inputs);
Filewriter(path... output.txt);
    loop(i=0; i<size; i++)
        write(string(name);
